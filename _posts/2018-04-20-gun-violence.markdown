The anti-gun violence movement, which has gained lot of attention because of the March 14 and 24 demonstrations, is entering a new phase on April 20.Commemorating the 19th anniversary of the April 1999 Columbine High School shooting, when twelve students and a teacher were fatally shot, four students from Ridgefield High School are calling upon us to participate in the #NationalSchoolWalkout.

Riled by the complacency and inaction that typically follows school shootings, the students started a petition that has garnered 2.5 million signatures. Their website states a three part-goal for the movement: holding elected representatives accountable, promoting solutions to gun violence, and engaging students in the political system.

Until the tragedy at Parkland, the Columbine massacre was the deadliest high school shooting in American history, and changed police response to mass shootings and active shooters. Capitalizing on the momentum of the #Enough and #NeverAgain movements, the marchers this Friday aim to honor the thirteen victims of Columbine with thirteen seconds of silence, calling upon their representatives for stricter gun laws and getting people to register to vote.
