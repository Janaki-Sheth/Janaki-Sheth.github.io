The American Dream is an ideology and philosophy that is considered integral to the identity of the United States and has gone on to shape national debates, government policies, and global propaganda. Often spoken of in conjunction with the values of democracy, liberty, and personal rights, the dream is supposed to stand for freedom and equal economic opportunity for prosperity and success. As coined in 1931 by James Truslow Adams, “…it is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable.”

The reverence for and the sanctity of the American Dream today may not remain as it was originally intended, but despite the tides of change, it continues to draw millions of immigrants to its shore from across the globe.
