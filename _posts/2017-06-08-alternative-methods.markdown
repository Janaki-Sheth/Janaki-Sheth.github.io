Tate, a professional cuddler and dominatrix, helps navigate through the world of highly misrepresented and societally stigmatized forms of arts â€“ arts that she firmly believes are therapeutic. In the same line as massages and acupuncture, cuddling and BDSM are elements of touch therapy.

While Tate is a firm advocate of this cause, we could all help if we start questioning societal norms and were open to breaking our internal barriers. Humans have a tendency to reach out to and welcome strangers into their lives, to seek love and compassion. Commodification of this need helps those who do not yet have the skills to acquire healthy touch on their own, and to fulfill their intrinsic need for more oxytocin and dopamine.
