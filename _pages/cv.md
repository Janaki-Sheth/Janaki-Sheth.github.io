I have been fortunate to work with Professors [Dolores Bozovic](http://www.pa.ucla.edu/directory/dolores-bozovic) and [Alex Levine](http://alevine.chem.ucla.edu/) on computational biophysics and statistical physics. I additionally collaborate with Professor [William Speier](https://mii.ucla.edu/people/wspeier/) on translating neural signals to text using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

My interests lie at the intersection of statistical mechanics, machine learning and neuroscience.

Previously, B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a major in Physics and minor in Electrical Engineering.
