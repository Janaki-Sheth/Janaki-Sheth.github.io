I am highly interested in statistical mechanics, machine learning and healthcare, and I have extensively worked at the intersection of these fields.

Currently, I am a Data Science Senior Consultant at [ClearView Healthcare Partners](https://clearviewhcp.com/) where I leverage real-world data sources, e.g. claims, electronic health records and physician surveys, to develop strategic insights and advise pharmaceutical enterprises in launch and commercialization of their drugs. My work often specializes in oncology indications.

Prior to ClearView, I was a postdoc in the [Lab of Auditory Coding](https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/hearing/positions/) at Perelman School of Medicine, UPenn where I studied how we perceive and process auditory information using bayesian models and network analysis.

In summer 2020, I interned with [Dr. Young-suk Lee](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-ysuklee) at the IBM Natural Language Processing group in Yorktown Heights working on Abstract Meaning Representation.

During my PhD years, I was fortunate to work with Professors [Dolores Bozovic](http://www.pa.ucla.edu/directory/dolores-bozovic) and [Alex Levine](http://alevine.chem.ucla.edu/) studying the inner ear transduction of sounds into electrical signals using methods from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. I additionally collaborated with Professor [William Speier](https://mii.ucla.edu/people/wspeier/) as a visiting researcher, on a brain-machine interface project where we translated neural signals to text using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Prior to this, I graduated with a B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a major in Engineering Physics and a minor in Electrical Engineering.
