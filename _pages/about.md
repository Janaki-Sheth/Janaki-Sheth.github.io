I am a postdoc in the [Lab of Auditory Coding](https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/hearing/positions/) at UPenn where I study how we process auditory information using bayesian models and neuronal network analysis.

My interests broadly lie at the intersection of statistical mechanics, machine learning and neuroscience.

In summer 2020, I interned with [Dr. Young-suk Lee](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-ysuklee) at IBM in Yorktown Heights working on Natural Language Processing.

During my PhD years, I have been fortunate to work with Professors [Dolores Bozovic](http://www.pa.ucla.edu/directory/dolores-bozovic) and the late [Alex Levine](http://alevine.chem.ucla.edu/) studying how the inner processes sounds into electrical signals using methods from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. I additionally collaborated with Professor [William Speier](https://mii.ucla.edu/people/wspeier/) as a visiting researcher, on a brain-machine interface project where we worked towards translating neural signals to text using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Prior to this, I graduated with a B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay majoring in Engineering Physics and with a minor in Electrical Engineering.

My resume can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/29gw4zs19ocuvnr/2021-04-22%20Janaki%20Sheth%20resume.pdf?dl=0) and complete academic CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ga38xg94kiyl2t/2021-08-07%20Janaki%20Sheth%20academic%20cv.pdf?dl=0).
