### Neural basis for auditory categorization
Perelman school of Medicine. UPenn <br> Septmeber 2020 - Present <br>
Advisors: Maria Geffen, Yale Cohen and Konrad Kording

1. Establish mechanisms underlying human perceptual decision-making using Bayesian models and generlaized linear models.

2. Investigate role of inhibitory neurons in auditory processing in the brain through multi-level analysis of neural network data.

### Research Internship: Natural Language Processing
IBM Watson <br> Summer 2020 <br>
Advisor: Young-suk Lee

Developed and trained multilingual AMR system using weak supervised learning within a large PyTorch codebase. Achieved highly competitive performance that surpassed SOTA in German, Spanish, Italian and Chinese.

### Thesis Research: Auditory system processing and neuroscience
Co-affiliated with the Audition lab and the Bhaumik Institute, UCLA<br>
Advisors: Dolores Bozovic and Alex Levine

[Fluctuation analysis of nonequilibrium limit cycle oscillators : Application to hair cells](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/66v0t1c6) <br>
Developed a general framework to study effects of stochasticity on non-equilibrium active limit cycle oscillators, specifically inner ear hair bundles, using principles drawn from dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. This framework advances our understanding of fluctuation theorems and how they may be used to probe complex biological systems.

### Development of a BCI interface for translation of neural signals to text
Visiting Graduate Student, Brain Computer Interface Lab, UCLA <br> July 2018 - Jan 2020 <br>
Advisor: William Speier

Analyzed multi-electrode ECoG data using supervised learning to detect novel features encapsulating speech production information. Additionally implemented a deep RNN and a temporal language model to identify underlying phonemes and generate text.

### Comparison of different deep neural network architectures in decoding speech-producing neural signals
Advisor: Jonathan Kao (Course: ECE 293AS)

Compared and critiqued performances (in Pytorch) using CNNs, bi-directional LSTMs and Autoencoders to map multi-electrode neural signals onto speech phonemes.

### Speech recognition and speaker verification
Advisor: Abeer Alwan (Courses: EE 241A and EE 241B)<br>

1. Robustness of features and models for text-dependent speaker verification <br>
Investigated speaker-dependent features and classifiers such as SVM and GMM, for speaker verification under constraints of noisy environments and short utterances.

2. Digit recognition under noisy and gender mismatch conditions<br>
Developed algorithm to address mismatch conditions in an automatic speech recognition task using hidden markov models. Experience using HTK toolkit.

### Reconstruction of the shape of a deformed interface
Soft Matter Physics group, TIFR <br>

Designed and implemented an algorithm to reconstruct the shape of a deformed interface (water surface with floating metallic micro-sphere) over a large spatial range.

### Study of spin-injection into electrolytes
Physics of Nanostructured Materials Lab, EPFL <br>

 Developed and characterized techniques to study dynamic nuclear polarization using passage of spin currents through ferro-magnetic electrodes.

### Micromagnetic simulation of magnetic reversal in magnetic nanodisks
Spintronics and Thin Film Magnetism Lab, IISc <br>

Investigated  through numerical simulations, the optimization of bit-patterned media for storage of information in hard disk magnetic material.
