### Development of a BCI interface for translation of neural signals to text
Visiting Graduate Student, Brain Computer Interface Lab <br> July 2018 - Present <br>

Advisors: William Speier

Analyzed multi-electrode ECoG data using supervised learning to detect novel features encapsulating speech production information. Additionally implemented a deep RNN and a temporal language model to identify underlying phonemes and generate text.

### Thesis Research: Auditory system processing and neuroscience
Advisors: Dolores Bozovic, Alex Levine

My graduate research is divided into two broad topics.
<br>I. Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of fluctuations in the inner ear<br>
Developed a general framework to study effects of noise on non-equilibrium active limit cycle oscillators, specifically inner ear hair bundles, using principles drawn from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics and computational biophysics.
<br>II. Modelling efferent connectivity in bullfrog sacculus<br>
Building an expansive model that studies effects of modulation in efferent neural activity on the acute sensitivity of the bullfrog sacculus.

### Comparison of different deep neural network architectures in decoding speech-producing neural signals
Advisor: Jonathan Kao (Course: ECE 293AS)

Compared and critiqued performances (in Pytorch) using CNNs, bi-directional LSTMs and Autoencoders to map multi-electrode neural signals onto speech phonemes.

### Robustness of features and models for text-dependent speaker verification

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course: EE 241A)

Investigated speaker-dependent features and classifiers such as SVM and GMM, for speaker verification under constraints of noisy environments and short utterances.

### Digit recognition under noisy and gender mismatch conditions

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course: EE 241B)

Developed algorithm to address mismatch conditions in an automatic speech recognition task using hidden markov models. Experience using HTK toolkit.
